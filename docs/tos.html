              <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>
              <p class="push-20-t">By using the related site software, services or web sites, you agree to the following terms and conditions, and any policies, guidelines or amendments thereto that may be presented to you from time to time, including but not limited to the following articles (collectively, the “Terms”).</p>

              <h2 class="push-20-t">Article 1: General</h2>

              <p class="push-20-t">The Software Provider (this site service developer and/or site owner) has the right to make adaptations to any related site or application at any given point in time without prior notification. The Software Provider also has the right to make adaptations to its website, application/s or other intellectual property of Software Provider at the moment Software Provider considers it to be useful or desirable to make those changes. Although uttermost care is taken to the development, management, privacy issues and other aspects of the mobile phone tracker application (reliability and accuracy of date, locations or any other data sent by mobile phone tracker application), Software Provider cannot be held liable nor responsible for damage resulting of inaccuracies, incomplete data of the mobile phone tracker application and/or technical issues. No rights can be issued for the data on the website of Software Provider or the website of its mobile phone tracker and other application(s) as well as for the e-mail newsletters send out by Software Provider. </p>

              <h2>Article 2: Registration</h2>

              <h2>Article 3: Participation</h2>
              <p class="push-20-t">Participation can be defined as everyone who fills out the registration form on the website(s) of Software Provider main website or product-specific web-site/s. All filled out data of the registration form will become the property of Software Provider as defined in Article 2. Every participant explicitly agrees with the General Terms and Conditions when filling out the registration form on the landing page of Software Provider's mobile phone tracker and other application/s.</p>

              <h2>Article 4: Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p class="push-20-t">During the Registration process (by creating an account using the web site or filling out the mobile device application form) we may collect your email address. By installing and using Software Provider software mobile application you also agree to send to Software Provider application internal databases the GPS Location, Battery Level Status and Network Status of the mobile device you installed the application on, at regular intervals. Also, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site(s). Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Software Provider application(s) users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: to personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs), to improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you) and to improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs). We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers. Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.</p>

              <h2>Article 5: Refund Policy</h2>

              <p class="push-20-t">Our ONLINE SERVICE offers a FREE Trial so you can check how the application works before you go Premium and process an order. Once you decide to purchase a PREMIUM License WE DO NOT OFFER REFUNDS, but of course, we will help you until the application works as expected.</p>

              <h2>Article 6: Liability</h2>

              <p class="push-20-t">Software Provider and its partners cannot be held liable nor responsible for any damage resulting out of the usage of its mobile phone tracker and other applications. Software Provider and its partners cannot be held liable nor responsible for any damage resulting out of privacy issues, data usage or any other circumstance relating to the personal data of registrants to Software Provider’s mobile phone tracker applications. Software Provider does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy of GPS satellite data, which is provided by a third party. Software Provider does not guarantee the accessibility of GPS satellite services. Furthermore, when these services are unavailable, locations provided will be approximate and provided by wifi network localization. An internet connection is not required to collect location data, but is required to send locations the the user’s account. Software Provider does not assume any responsibility for lapses in location updates due to lack of device connectivity to a wifi or 3G network. Depending on the model and manufacturer of the mobile devices, GPS location services will occupy more or less battery usage. Software Provider GPS tracking applications run in the background and keep the device from shutting down or sleeping (allowing the application to continually gather device locations). This can have a significant effect on the battery-life of the mobile device. Mobile phone tracker applications always appear in the applications list and can be uninstalled by the user at any time. Therefore, Software Provider assumes no responsibility for lack of functionality due to the uninstallation of the application by the user.</p>

              <h2>Article 7: Final issues</h2>

              <p class="push-20-t">In case of legal issues or litigation, the registrant agrees with the acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions that the Spanish law will apply and that the courts in Barcelona (Spain) will be appointed. Software Provider and its partners have the right to exclude and/or refuse registrants that provide illegal (personal) data or that have committed fraud against the terms and conditions speculated herein this document. Software Provider and its partners have the right to finish or adapt the GPS tracking device application as well as the General Terms and Conditions at any given point in time without prior (written) notification. These General Terms and Conditions are copyrighted by Software Provider. Nothing may be copied or duplicated in whatever form without the explicit consent of Software Provider. Adaptations and typos are reserved. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.</p>
